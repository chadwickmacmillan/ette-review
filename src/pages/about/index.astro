          <span class="italic">-ette</span>'s editors, <strong>Beth Hahn</strong> and <strong>Nora
          Maynard</strong>, met at Bread Loaf Writers' Conference in Amy Hempel's
          workshop. They share a love of gorgeous prose, writing that arcs
          strange, and small-form work. They bonded over Murakami, cats, and
          music (Nora plays violin; Beth, guitar).
        </p>

        <p>
          Beth met <strong>Melanie Hoopes</strong> when Melanie signed up for Beth's fiction
          workshop in March of 2020. They met once in-person, right before the
          pandemic, and then zoomed for two years. That class morphed into a
          writing group and Beth and Melanie morphed into friends. <span
            class="italic">Pod-ette</span
          >, <span class="italic">-ette</span>'s companion podcast, is created
          and produced by Melanie.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="italic">-ette</span>&nbsp;is seasonal, small, and
