<p><span class="bold">ON ROULETTE:</span></p>

<p>Games of chance, fate, the unknown. We’re interested in reversals of fortune, luck, the house. We like the glamor of old films and the lucky charm. Or consider roulette as a small wheel, an engraver’s tool, a stamp device. We are <span class="italic">not</span> interested in Russian roulette (thanks), but all else goes. Spin the wheel of your imagination and send us your best work.</p>

<p class="bold">Etymology</p>
<p class="bold">roulette (n.)</p>
<p>"game of chance involving a revolving disk on a table," 1745; earlier "small wheel" (1734), from French <span class="italic">roulette</span> "gambling game played with a revolving wheel," an extended sense; "small wheel," from Old French <span class="italic">roelete</span> "little wheel" (12c.), formed on model of Late Latin <span class="italic">rotella</span>, diminutive of Latin <span class="italic">rota</span> "wheel" (see rotary). An older name for this game was <span class="italic">roly-poly</span> or <span class="italic">rouly-pouly</span> (1712).<br>

<p class="bold">Definition</p>
<p class="bold">roulette</p>
<p>noun</p>
<ol class="number-list">
  <li>a game of chance played at a table marked off with numbers from 1 to 36, one or two zeros, and several other sections affording the players a variety of betting opportunities, and having in the center a revolving, dish like device roulette wheel into which a small ball is spun to come to rest finally in one of the 37 or 38 compartments, indicating the winning number and its characteristics, as odd or even, red or black, and between 1 and 18 or 19 and 36.</li>
  <li>a small wheel, especially one with sharp teeth, mounted in a handle, for making lines of marks, dots, or perforations:<br><span class="italic">engravers' roulettes; a roulette for perforating sheets of postage stamps.</span></li>
  <li><span class="italic">Philately.</span> a row of short cuts, in which no paper is removed, made between individual stamps to permit their ready separation. <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/roulette">(http://www.dictionary.com/browse/roulette)</a></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p class="bold">Some History</p>
<p>In 1655, the first, crude version of the roulette wheel was created by the French mathematician and inventor, Blaise Pascal, in his quest to create a perpetual motion machine—or a machine, that once started, could not be stopped, and would run on its own mechanism. Others added to the invention, turning it into the classic <span class="italic">rouge et noir</span> casino game. It gained popularity with King Charles III of Monaco, who built a casino that housed a beautiful roulette wheel. He added a zero to the wheel. This tilted roulette in the house’s favor, and Charles’s kingdom expanded.</p>
