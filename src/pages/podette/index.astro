          Welcome to <span class="italic">pod-ette</span>, the podcast companion
          to the literary magazine <span class="italic">-ette</span>! </p>

<p>In Episode 6, Melanie gives a prescription for these preposterous times: a heavy dose of art (among other things). She talks with Rachel Kowalsky (“Dear Dolores”) and Matt Leibel (“How to Buy a Snow Globe”) about work that has recently reconfigured them.

<p>In Episode 5, Melanie Hoopes is existing in a gloomy fantasy world until she finds a little glimmer of hope in the re-creation of a horrendous natural disaster. She visits with S.D. Pergola (“Thoughts on the Incoming Snow”), Jessica Barlevi (“Forest of Light”), and Amy Holman (“Stuck”) about how they are faring in these treacherous times.

          <p>In Episode 3, Melanie Hoopes remembers a talk show host talking smack about writers and rushes to their defense. She chats with Cathy Ulrich (“Being the Murdered Jane Doe”), Bryana Joy (“What Audrey One Did” and “What Ophelia Did”), and Kelle Groom (“Babylonian Almanac”). As well as telling us how their pieces came to be, this issue’s writers share how and where they write best. Original music for <span class="italic">pod-ette</span> is by Chester Jankowski.</p>
