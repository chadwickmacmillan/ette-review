<h1><strong>Lichen on Moss</strong></h1>

<h2>by Dawn Macdonald</h2>

<p><span class="italic">“Il faut juger de la doctrine par les miracles, il faut juger des miracles par la doctrine. La doctrine discerne les miracles, et les miracles discernent la doctrine. Tout cela est vrai: mais cela ne se contredit pas.”<br>
—Blaise Pascal</span></p>

<p>One must judge the lichen by the moss; one must judge the moss by the lichen. The lichen discerns the lichen. This is moss. Vascularity is given. That which is given is a given. Lichen sucks rock. Rock disperses cloud. Clouds disperse. Moss needs rain like lichen needs. Lichen needs are dispersed. Moss likes clumps. One must judge the clump by its nutrient concentration. One must concentrate if one is to dispense with truth.</p>
