<h1><strong>Death in Los Angeles</strong></h1>

<h2>by Emma Raimondo</h2>

<p>My mother is a realtor with a taste for wood paneling. She specializes in mid-century modern homes. Homes built when bans on filling swimming pools were in place. She likes a wide, rectangular view of the hills. When she tours a potential listing, she stands in front of the widest window and worries when an earthquake will hit.</p>

<p>When I visit her, I stop by the Griffith Observatory. Our old field trip spot. We would drive up after a quake to use public telescopes. I gazed through the scope and wondered about her homes.</p>

<p>Once, I had a dream about the children from a small Swedish family she sold a house to. Two toddlers playing wood blocks on an orange shag rug, folded into the earth. A block hits the knee, a rock hits the head. I wondered about geometry, what new shape the home could take. What the bird sculptures would bludgeon.</p>

<p>My mother calls me the day after an earthquake, never the day of. She likes a buffer in case she dies. Avert an aftershock jinx. If she calls in the morning, she could die in the afternoon.</p>
