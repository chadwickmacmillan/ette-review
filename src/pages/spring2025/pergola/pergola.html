<h1><strong>Thoughts on the Incoming Snow</strong></h1>

<h2>by S.D. Pergola</h2>

<p>I used to lie to optometrists pathologically. It’s lost to my present self why I so desperately wanted glasses in those more innocent years, but I do recall with clearest detail my hysterics as I, time and again, was dragged barefaced out of the antiseptic-scented lobby by my bespectacled mother.</p>

<p>When I tell this to Luis he scoffs––those less optically fortunate always do––but then he says he can’t imagine not having glasses. In moments of confusion or deepest sadness or just plain boredom, he explains, it is essential to remove one’s lenses, to see as muffled and as dull as it all seems.</p>

<p>Lacking this faculty, I sit around for days and wait for it to snow.</p>
