<h1><strong>Landlines</strong></h1>

<h2>by Suzy Eynon</h2>

<p>I climb a hill and part overgrown raspberry vines to find a wind phone, the box mounted to an evergreen trunk. No wires to press lines into moss. I call my dead cat, whisper his name into the plastic receiver. I wish to send a message, but I receive unilateral transmissions. A bot bearing the name of my dead uncle requests to follow me. The sole <span class="italic">like</span> on my web site is from a departed friend. I block my mother-in-law on social media after I see her avatar—it’s a photo of my dead cat and appears in the <span class="italic">you may know</span> section as a suggested contact. Of course I know him. I watched him leave. I call my dead cat on the wind phone, and I say: <span class="italic">I miss you</span>. I carry a rootless memory from childhood: of reading, or watching, or hearing a prediction about all phones ringing in unison at the end of the world, before the collective lights go out. I grew up in the 1980s so all the memory phones are corded. Ears tethered. Life is lived in anticipation of a bell ringing, in the quiet just before the trill. Instead of one long tone, it comes at me in bursts, pulses. I’ve lost the decoder. No, I say: <span class="italic">see you soon</span>.
